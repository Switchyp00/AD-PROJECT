# Active Directory Lab with Splunk Integration

Welcome to my cybersecurity project lab—a hands-on exploration of building and monitoring a Windows-based domain environment using Splunk. This project simulates a mini enterprise setup for log collection, monitoring, and basic defensive security concepts.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This lab demonstrates the configuration of a Windows Active Directory domain, domain-joined client, and log forwarding to a centralized Splunk server for analysis. The purpose is to showcase my skills in system administration, log management, and cybersecurity fundamentals.

### 🖥️ Lab Components

- **DC1 (Domain Controller)** – Windows Server  
- **Client1 (Domain-Joined Workstation)** – Windows 10/11  
- **SplunkServer (Log Receiver)** – Ubuntu with Splunk Enterprise  

---

## 🔧 Configurations and Highlights

- Installed and configured **Active Directory Domain Services**
- Joined a client machine to the domain (`soclab.local`)
- Created and managed domain users via ADUC
- Set up **Group Policy Objects (GPOs)** and tested file sharing
- Installed and configured **Splunk Universal Forwarders** on both DC1 and Client1
- Configured log forwarding for **Windows Security logs**
- Validated successful log ingestion in Splunk Enterprise
